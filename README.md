# Kleptography

This is the repository of my bachelor's thesis. It will mainly contain results of my research, bits of ideas I have written down for my thesis and PoC (at the beginning) of different kleptography attacks I implemented to ultimately develop an attack scenario to present what kleptography is to the general public.

## Description

In 1996, Young and Yung developed the idea of kleptography: it aims to study how it is possible for an attacker to steal data in a secure and subversive way. This field of study was previously only studied by academics, but following the Snowden affair in 2013 and the disclosure of NSA documents showing the latter's involvement in carrying out possible kleptographic attacks, the threat has become a bit more concrete and taken seriously. In order to raise awareness among a public that is both novice and somewhat initiated in security, this bachelor thesis will present the main concepts of kleptography, define the notions used in kleptography and discuss some cryptographic systems currently used in the world that may contain a backdoor.
